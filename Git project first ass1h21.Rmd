## **Introduction**

In this paper we will discuss the differences between replicability and
reproducibility, the importance of reproducibility in science and how R
Notebook may be a potential solution to this problem.

The emphasis on reproducibility in computational science has become an
increasingly important subject in the world of science and economics.
Innovations in for example new technologies have made it possible to
make great progress in the field of science, with many new discoveries
being made. However, as McNutt (2014, p. 226) states in the beginning of
the editorial in *Science*: *"Science advances on a foundation of
trusted discoveries"*. Many scientific papers are shown in later years
to be falsely concluded, such as Giles and Tedd´s (2002) book about the
Canadian underground economy. Therefore, we can´t see the advancements
in science in the share number of new discoveries being made, but rather
the quality of them and that they are trusted. One such way of judging
the scientific claims is what Peng (2011) means to being a minimum
requirement when replication is not possible, that the study is
reproducible.



## Short literature review

In the spectrum of reproducibility a full replication is considered the
"gold standard" in science. We can define replicability as "*the ability
of a researcher to duplicate the result of a prior study if the same
procedures are followed but new data are collected*" (Bollen et al.,
2015, p. 7). Whereas reproducibility is seen as "*the ability of a
researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same
materials and procedures as were used by the original investigator*"
(Bollen et al., 2015, p. 6). Hence a full replication of a study may
prove to be quite expensive and time consuming, many researcher have
been calling for reproducible research as minimum standard to validate
scientific claims (Peng, 2014).


## Discussion

When performing research in R notebooks all codes used trough the performance is saved and documented. Accordingly, R notebooks helps reduce a barrier to reproducibility by making codes available. Published and available codes give other researchers and scientis the ability to follow the same procedures when duplicating research.
